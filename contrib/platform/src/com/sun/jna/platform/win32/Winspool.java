     *            If Level is 1, Flags contains PRINTER_ENUM_NAME, and Name is
     *            non-NULL, then Name is a pointer to a null-terminated string
     *            that specifies the name of the object to enumerate. This
     *            string can be the name of a server, a domain, or a print
     *            provider. If Level is 1, Flags contains PRINTER_ENUM_NAME, and
     *            Name is NULL, then the function enumerates the available print
     *            providers. If Level is 1, Flags contains PRINTER_ENUM_REMOTE,
     *            and Name is NULL, then the function enumerates the printers in
     *            the user's domain. If Level is 2 or 5,Name is a pointer to a
     *            null-terminated string that specifies the name of a server
     *            whose printers are to be enumerated. If this string is NULL,
     *            then the function enumerates the printers installed on the
     *            local computer. If Level is 4, Name should be NULL. The

     *            that are physically attached to the local machine as well as
     *            remote printers to which it has a network connection. When
     *            Name is not NULL, setting Flags to PRINTER_ENUM_LOCAL |
     *            PRINTER_ENUM_NAME enumerates the local printers that are
     *            installed on the server Name.

     *            PRINTER_INFO_5 data structures.

     *            PRINTER_INFO_5 structures. Each structure contains data that
     *            describes an available print object. If Level is 1, the array
     *            contains PRINTER_INFO_1 structures. If Level is 2, the array
     *            contains PRINTER_INFO_2 structures. If Level is 4, the array
     *            contains PRINTER_INFO_4 structures. If Level is 5, the array

     *            buffer is too small, the pcbNeeded parameter returns the
