     * OleFlushClipboard renders the data from a data object onto the clipboard
     * and releases the IDataObject pointer to the data object. While the
     * application that put the data object on the clipboard is running, the
     * clipboard holds only a pointer to the data object, thus saving memory.
     * If you are writing an application that acts as the source of a clipboard
     * operation, you can call the OleFlushClipboard function when your
     * application is closed, such as when the user exits from your application.
     * Calling OleFlushClipboard enables pasting and paste-linking of OLE
     * objects after application shutdown.
     * Before calling OleFlushClipboard, you can easily determine if your data
     * is still on the clipboard with a call to the OleIsCurrentClipboard
     * function.
     *
     * OleFlushClipboard leaves all formats offered by the data transfer object,
     * including the OLE 1 compatibility formats, on the clipboard so they are
     * available after application shutdown. In addition to OLE 1 compatibility
     * formats, these include all formats offered on a global handle medium (all
     * except for TYMED_FILE) and formatted with a null target device. For
     * example, if a data-source application offers a particular clipboard
     * format (say cfFOO) on an IStorage object, and calls the OleFlushClipboard
     * function, the storage object is copied into memory and the hglobal memory
     * handle is put on the clipboard.
     *
     * To retrieve the information on the clipboard, you can call the
     * OleGetClipboard function from another application, which creates a
     * default data object, and the hglobal from the clipboard again becomes a
     * storage object. Furthermore, the FORMATETC enumerator and the
     * IDataObject::QueryGetData method would all correctly indicate that the
     * original clipboard format (cfFOO) is again available on a TYMED_ISTORAGE.
     *
     * To empty the clipboard, call the OleSetClipboard function specifying a
     * null value for its parameter. The application should call this when it
     * closes if there is no need to leave data on the clipboard after shutdown,
     * or if data will be placed on the clipboard using the standard Windows
     * clipboard functions.
