     *            overlapped or pop-up window, the x parameter is the initial
     *            x-coordinate of the window's upper-left corner, in screen
     *            coordinates. For a child window, x is the x-coordinate of the
     *            upper-left corner of the window relative to the upper-left
     *            corner of the parent window's client area. If x is set to
     *            CW_USEDEFAULT, the system selects the default position for the
     *            window's upper-left corner and ignores the y parameter.
     *            CW_USEDEFAULT is valid only for overlapped windows; if it is
     *            specified for a pop-up or child window, the x and y parameters
     *            are set to zero.
     *
     * @param y
     *            [in] Type: int
     *
     *            The initial vertical position of the window. For an overlapped
     *            or pop-up window, the y parameter is the initial y-coordinate
     *            of the window's upper-left corner, in screen coordinates. For
     *            a child window, y is the initial y-coordinate of the
     *            upper-left corner of the child window relative to the
     *            upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. For a
     *            list box y is the initial y-coordinate of the upper-left
     *            corner of the list box's client area relative to the
     *            upper-left corner of the parent window's client area.
     *
     *            If an overlapped window is created with the WS_VISIBLE style
     *            bit set and the x parameter is set to CW_USEDEFAULT, then the
     *            y parameter determines how the window is shown. If the y
     *            parameter is CW_USEDEFAULT, then the window manager calls
     *            ShowWindow with the SW_SHOW flag after the window has been
     *            created. If the y parameter is some other value, then the
     *            window manager calls ShowWindow with that value as the
     *            nCmdShow parameter.
     *
     * @param nWidth
     *            [in] Type: int
     *
     *            The width, in device units, of the window. For overlapped
     *            windows, nWidth is the window's width, in screen coordinates,
     *            or CW_USEDEFAULT. If nWidth is CW_USEDEFAULT, the system
     *            selects a default width and height for the window; the default
     *            width extends from the initial x-coordinates to the right edge
     *            of the screen; the default height extends from the initial
     *            y-coordinate to the top of the icon area. CW_USEDEFAULT is
     *            valid only for overlapped windows; if CW_USEDEFAULT is
     *            specified for a pop-up or child window, the nWidth and nHeight
     *            parameter are set to zero.
     *
     * @param nHeight
     *            [in] Type: int
     *
     *            The height, in device units, of the window. For overlapped
     *            windows, nHeight is the window's height, in screen
     *            coordinates. If the nWidth parameter is set to CW_USEDEFAULT,
     *            the system ignores nHeight.
     *
     * @param hWndParent
     *            [in, optional] Type: HWND
     *
     *            A handle to the parent or owner window of the window being
     *            created. To create a child window or an owned window, supply a
     *            valid window handle. This parameter is optional for pop-up
     *            windows.
     *
     *            To create a message-only window, supply HWND_MESSAGE or a
     *            handle to an existing message-only window.
     *
     * @param hMenu
     *            [in, optional] Type: HMENU
     *
     *            A handle to a menu, or specifies a child-window identifier,
     *            depending on the window style. For an overlapped or pop-up
     *            window, hMenu identifies the menu to be used with the window;
     *            it can be NULL if the class menu is to be used. For a child
     *            window, hMenu specifies the child-window identifier, an
     *            integer value used by a dialog box control to notify its
     *            parent about events. The application determines the
     *            child-window identifier; it must be unique for all child
     *            windows with the same parent window.
     *
     * @param hInstance

     *            A handle to the instance of the module to be associated with

     * @param lpParam
     *            [in, optional] Type: LPVOID

     *            the lParam param of the WM_CREATE message. This message is
     *            sent to the created window by this function before it returns.
     *
     *            If an application calls CreateWindow to create a MDI client
     *            window, lpParam should point to a CLIENTCREATESTRUCT
     *            structure. If an MDI client window calls CreateWindow to
     *            create an MDI child window, lpParam should point to a
     *            MDICREATESTRUCT structure. lpParam may be NULL if no
     *            additional data is needed.
     *

     * During a shutdown or log-off operation, running applications are allowed a specific

     *            This flag has no effect when both the calling process and the
     *            generating process are not 32-bit or 64-bit processes, or when
