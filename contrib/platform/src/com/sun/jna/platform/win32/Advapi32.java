     * @param pdwType
     *            [out, optional]
     *
     *            A pointer to a variable that receives a code indicating the
     *            type of data stored in the specified value. For a list of the
     *            possible type codes, see Registry Value Types. This parameter
     *            can be NULL if the type is not required.

     *            parameter can be NULL if the data is not required.
     *
     *            If the data is a string, the function checks for a terminating
     *            null character. If one is not found, the string is stored with
     *            a null terminator if the buffer is large enough to accommodate
     *            the extra character. Otherwise, the function fails and returns
     *            ERROR_MORE_DATA.
     *
     * @param pcbData
     *            [in, out, optional]
     *
     *            A pointer to a variable that specifies the size of the buffer
     *            pointed to by the pvData parameter, in bytes. When the
     *            function returns, this variable contains the size of the data
     *            copied to pvData.
     *
     *            The pcbData parameter can be NULL only if pvData is NULL.
     *
     *            If the data has the REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ
     *            type, this size includes any terminating null character or
     *            characters. For more information, see Remarks.
     *
     *            If the buffer specified by pvData parameter is not large
     *            enough to hold the data, the function returns ERROR_MORE_DATA
     *            and stores the required buffer size in the variable pointed to
     *            by pcbData. In this case, the contents of the pvData buffer
     *            are undefined.
     *
     *            If pvData is NULL, and pcbData is non-NULL, the function
     *            returns ERROR_SUCCESS and stores the size of the data, in
     *            bytes, in the variable pointed to by pcbData. This enables an
     *            application to determine the best way to allocate a buffer for
     *            the value's data.
     *
     *            If hKey specifies HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA and the pvData buffer
     *            is not large enough to contain all of the returned data, the
     *            function returns ERROR_MORE_DATA and the value returned
     *            through the pcbData parameter is undefined. This is because
     *            the size of the performance data can change from one call to
     *            the next. In this case, you must increase the buffer size and
     *            call RegGetValue again passing the updated buffer size in the
     *            pcbData parameter. Repeat this until the function succeeds.
     *            You need to maintain a separate variable to keep track of the
     *            buffer size, because the value returned by pcbData is
     *            unpredictable.
     *
     *            Return value If the function succeeds, the return value is
     *            ERROR_SUCCESS. If the function fails, the return value is a
     *            system error code. If the pvData buffer is too small to
     *            receive the value, the function returns ERROR_MORE_DATA.

     *            If the executable module is a 16-bit application,
     *            lpApplicationName should be NULL, and the string pointed to by
     *            lpCommandLine should specify the executable module and its
     *            arguments.
     * @param lpCommandLine
     *            [in, out, optional]<br>
     *            The command line to be executed. The maximum length of this
     *            string is 1024 characters. <br>
     *            If lpApplicationName is NULL, the module name portion of
     *            lpCommandLine is limited to MAX_PATH characters.<br>
     *            The function can modify the contents of this string. <br>
     *            Therefore, this parameter cannot be a pointer to read-only
     *            memory (such as a const variable or a literal string).<br>
     *            If this parameter is a constant string, the function may cause
     *            an access violation.<br>
     *            The lpCommandLine parameter can be NULL, and the function uses
     *            the string pointed to by lpApplicationNameas the command line.
     *            <br>
     *            <br>
     *            If both lpApplicationName and lpCommandLine are non-NULL,
     *            *lpApplicationName specifies the module to execute, and
     *            *lpCommandLine specifies the command line.<br>
     *            The new process can use GetCommandLine to retrieve the entire
     *            command line.<br>
     *            Console processes written in C can use the argc and argv
     *            arguments to parse the command line. <br>
     *            Because argv[0] is the module name, C programmers typically
     *            repeat the module name as the first token in the command line.
     *            <br>
     *            If lpApplicationName is NULL, the first white space-delimited
     *            token of the command line specifies the module name.<br>
     *            If you are using a long file name that contains a space, use
     *            quoted strings to indicate where the file name ends and the
     *            arguments begin (see the explanation for the lpApplicationName
     *            parameter). If the file name does not contain an extension,
     *            .exe is appended. Therefore, if the file name extension is
     *            .com, this parameter must include the .com extension. If the
     *            file name ends in a period with no extension, or if the file
     *            name contains a path, .exe is not appended. If the file name
     *            does not contain a directory path, the system searches for the
     *            executable file in the following sequence:<br>
     *            <br>
     *            1. The directory from which the application loaded.<br>
     *            2. The current directory for the parent process.<br>
     *            3. The 32-bit Windows system directory. Use the
     *            GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
     *            <br>
     *            4. The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no function
     *            that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched.
     *            <br>
     *            5. The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function
     *            to get the path of this directory.<br>
     *            6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
     *            variable. Note that this function does not search the
     *            per-application path specified by the App Paths registry key.
     *            To include this per-application path in the search sequence,
     *            use the ShellExecute function.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            The system adds a null character to the command line string to
     *            separate the file name from the arguments. This divides the
     *            original string into two strings for internal processing.<br>
     * @param dwCreationFlags
     *            The flags that control how the process is created. <br>
     *            The CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE, CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, and
     *            CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flags are enabled by default. <br>
     *            Even if you do not set the flag, the system functions as if it
     *            were set. You can specify additional flags as noted.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE: 0x04000000<br>
     *            The new process does not inherit the error mode of the calling
     *            process. <br>
     *            Instead, CreateProcessWithLogonW gives the new process the
     *            current default error mode. <br>
     *            An application sets the current default error mode by calling
     *            SetErrorMode. This flag is enabled by default.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE: 0x00000010<br>
     *            The new process has a new console, instead of inheriting the
     *            parent's console. This flag cannot be used with the
     *            DETACHED_PROCESS flag.<br>
     *            This flag is enabled by default.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP: 0x00000200<br>
     *            The new process is the root process of a new process group.
     *            <br>
     *            The process group includes all processes that are descendants
     *            of this root process.<br>
     *            The process identifier of the new process group is the same as
     *            the process identifier, which is returned in the lpProcessInfo
     *            parameter.<br>
     *            Process groups are used by the GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent
     *            function to enable sending a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal to a
     *            group of console processes.<br>
     *            This flag is enabled by default.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM: 0x00000800<br>
     *            This flag is only valid starting a 16-bit Windows-based
     *            application.<br>
     *            If set, the new process runs in a private Virtual DOS Machine
     *            (VDM).<br>
     *            By default, all 16-bit Windows-based applications run in a
     *            single, shared VDM.<br>
     *            The advantage of running separately is that a crash only
     *            terminates the single VDM; any other programs running in
     *            distinct VDMs continue to function normally.<br>
     *            Also, 16-bit Windows-based applications that run in separate
     *            VDMs have separate input queues, which means that if one
     *            application stops responding momentarily, applications in
     *            separate VDMs continue to receive input. <br>
     *            CREATE_SUSPENDED: 0x00000004<br>
     *            The primary thread of the new process is created in a
     *            suspended state, and does not run until the ResumeThread
     *            function is called.<br>
     *            <br>
     *            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT: 0x00000400<br>
     *            Indicates the format of the lpEnvironment parameter.<br>
     *            If this flag is set, the environment block pointed to by
     *            lpEnvironment uses Unicode characters. <br>
     *            Otherwise, the environment block uses ANSI characters. <br>
     *            EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT: 0x00080000<br>
     *            The process is created with extended startup information; the
     *            lpStartupInfo parameter specifies a STARTUPINFOEX structure.
     *            <br>
     *            Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: This value is not
     *            supported.<br>
     * @param lpEnvironment
     *            [in, optional]<br>
     *            A pointer to an environment block for the new process.<br>
     *            If this parameter is NULL, the new process uses an environment
     *            created from the profile of the user specified by lpUsername.
     *            An environment block consists of a null-terminated block of
     *            null-terminated strings.<br>
     *            Each string is in the following form:<br>
     *            name=value<br>
     *            Because the equal sign (=) is used as a separator, it must not
     *            be used in the name of an environment variable.<br>
     *            An environment block can contain Unicode or ANSI characters.
     *            <br>
     *            If the environment block pointed to by lpEnvironment contains
     *            Unicode characters, ensure that dwCreationFlags includes
     *            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT.<br>
     *            If this parameter is NULL and the environment block of the
     *            parent process contains Unicode characters, you must also
     *            ensure that dwCreationFlags includes
     *            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT.<br>
     *            An ANSI environment block is terminated by two 0 (zero) bytes:
     *            one for the last string and one more to terminate the block.
     *            <br>
     *            A Unicode environment block is terminated by four zero bytes:
     *            two for the last string and two more to terminate the block.
     *            <br>
     *            To retrieve a copy of the environment block for a specific
     *            user, use the CreateEnvironmentBlock function.<br>
     * @param lpCurrentDirectory
     *            [in, optional]<br>
     *            The full path to the current directory for the process.<br>
     *            The string can also specify a UNC path.<br>
     *            If this parameter is NULL, the new process has the same
     *            current drive and directory as the calling process.<br>
     *            This feature is provided primarily for shells that need to
     *            start an application, and specify its initial drive and
     *            working directory.<br>
     * @param lpStartupInfo
     *            [in]<br>
     *            A pointer to a STARTUPINFO or STARTUPINFOEX structure. <br>
     *            The application must add permission for the specified user
     *            account to the specified window station and desktop, even for
     *            WinSta0\Default.<br>
     *            If the lpDesktop member is NULL or an empty string, the new
     *            process inherits the desktop and window station of its parent
     *            process.<br>
     *            The application must add permission for the specified user
     *            account to the inherited window station and desktop.<br>
     *            Windows XP: CreateProcessWithLogonW adds permission for the
     *            specified user account to the inherited window station and
     *            desktop.<br>
     *            Handles in STARTUPINFO or STARTUPINFOEX must be closed with
     *            CloseHandle when they are no longer needed.<br>
     *            Important If the dwFlags member of the STARTUPINFO structure
     *            specifies STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, the standard handle fields are
     *            copied unchanged to the child process without validation.<br>
     *            The caller is responsible for ensuring that these fields
     *            contain valid handle values. Incorrect values can cause the
     *            child process to misbehave or crash.<br>
     *            Use the Application Verifier runtime verification tool to
     *            detect invalid handles.
     * @param lpProcessInfo
     *            [out]<br>
     *            A pointer to a PROCESS_INFORMATION structure that receives
