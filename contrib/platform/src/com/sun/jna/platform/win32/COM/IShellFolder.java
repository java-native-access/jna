     *
     * Retrieves pointers to the supported interfaces on an object.
     * This method calls IUnknown::AddRef on the pointer it returns.
     *
     * @param riid
     *            The identifier of the interface being requested.
     *
     * @param ppvObject
     *            The address of a pointer variable that receives the interface pointer requested in the riid parameter. Upon successful
     *            return, *ppvObject contains the requested interface pointer to the object. If the object does not support the
     *            interface, *ppvObject is set to NULL.
     *
     * @return
     *            This method returns S_OK if the interface is supported, and E_NOINTERFACE otherwise. If ppvObject is NULL, this method returns E_POINTER.
     *            For any one object, a specific query for the IUnknown interface on any of the object's interfaces must always return the same pointer value.
     *            This enables a client to determine whether two pointers point to the same component by calling QueryInterfacewith IID_IUnknown
     *            and comparing the results. It is specifically not the case that queries for interfaces other than IUnknown (even the same interface
     *            through the same pointer) must return the same pointer value.
     *
     *            There are four requirements for implementations of QueryInterface (In these cases, "must succeed" means "must succeed barring
     *            catastrophic failure."):
     *            The set of interfaces accessible on an object through QueryInterface must be static, not dynamic. This means that if a call
     *            toQueryInterface for a pointer to a specified interface succeeds the first time, it must succeed again, and if it fails
     *            the first time, it must fail on all subsequent queries. 
     *
     *            It must be reflexive: if a client holds a pointer to an interface on an object, and queries for that interface, the call must succeed. 
     *
     *            It must be symmetric: if a client holding a pointer to one interface queries successfully for another, a query through
     *            the obtained pointer for the first interface must succeed. 
     *
     *            It must be transitive: if a client holding a pointer to one interface queries successfully for a second, and through that
     *            pointer queries successfully for a third interface, a query for the first interface through the pointer for the
     *            third interface must succeed. 
     *            Notes to Implementers
     *            Implementations of QueryInterface must never check ACLs. The main reason for this rule is that COM requires that an object supporting a
     *            particular interface always return success when queried for that interface. Another reason is that checking ACLs on QueryInterface
     *            does not provide any real security because any client who has access to a particular interface can hand it directly to another
     *            client without any calls back to the server. Also, because COM caches interface pointers, it does not callQueryInterface on
     *            the server every time a client does a query.
