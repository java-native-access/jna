     *            null character. If <i>lpApplicationName</i> is NULL, the

     *            The Unicode version of this function, {@link #CreateProcessW},
     *            can modify the contents of this string. Therefore, this
     *            parameter cannot be a pointer to read-only memory (such as a
     *            const variable or a literal string). If this parameter is a
     *            constant string, the function may cause an access violation.
     *            </p><p>
     *            The <i>lpCommandLine</i> parameter can be NULL. In that case,
     *            the function uses the string pointed to by
     *            <i>lpApplicationName</i> as the command line.
     *            </p><p>
     *            If both <i>lpApplicationName</i> and <i>lpCommandLine</i> are
     *            non-NULL, the null-terminated string pointed to by
     *            <i>lpApplicationName</i> specifies the module to execute, and
     *            the null-terminated string pointed to by <i>lpCommandLine</i>
     *            specifies the command line. The new process can use
     *            GetCommandLine to retrieve the entire command line. Console
     *            processes written in C can use the argc and argv arguments to
     *            parse the command line. Because argv[0] is the module name, C
     *            programmers generally repeat the module name as the first
     *            token in the command line.
     *            </p>
     *            If <i>lpApplicationName</i> is NULL, the first white
     *            space-delimited token of the command line specifies the module
     *            name. If you are using a long file name that contains a space,
     *            use quoted strings to indicate where the file name ends and
     *            the arguments begin (see the explanation for the
     *            <i>lpApplicationName</i> parameter). If the file name does not
     *            contain an extension, .exe is appended. Therefore, if the file
     *            name extension is .com, this parameter must include the .com
     *            extension. If the file name ends in a period (.) with no
     *            extension, or if the file name contains a path, .exe is not
     *            appended. If the file name does not contain a directory path,
     *            the system searches for the executable file in the following
     *            sequence:
     *            <ul>
     *            <li>The directory from which the application loaded.
     *            <li>The current directory for the parent process.
     *            <li>The 32-bit Windows system directory. Use the
     *            GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
     *            <li>The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no function
     *            that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched.
     *            The name of this directory is System.
     *            <li>The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory
     *            function to get the path of this directory.
     *            <li>The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
     *            variable. Note that this function does not search the
     *            per-application path specified by the App Paths registry key.
     *            To include this per-application path in the search sequence,
     *            use the ShellExecute function.
     *            </ul>
     *            The system adds a terminating null character to the
     *            command-line string to separate the file name from the
     *            arguments. This divides the original string into two strings
     *            for internal processing.
     * @param lpProcessAttributes

     *            whether the returned handle to the new process object can be
     *            inherited by child processes. If lpProcessAttributes is NULL,

     *            the handle cannot be inherited.
     * @param bInheritHandles
     *            If this parameter TRUE, each inheritable handle in the calling
     *            process is inherited by the new process. If the parameter is
     *            FALSE, the handles are not inherited. Note that inherited

     *            new starting point. If lpOverlapped is NULL, lpBytesReturned

     *            module-definition (.def) file. <br>
     *            The module can be a library module (a .dll file) or an
     *            executable module (an .exe file). If the specified module is

     *            information. <br>
     *            If the string specifies a module name without a path and the
     *            file name extension is omitted, the function appends the

     *            If the string specifies a fully qualified path, the function
     *            searches only that path for the module. When specifying a

     *            For more information about paths, see "Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces" on MSDN. <br>
     *            If the string specifies a module name without a path and more

     *            module of the same name is not already loaded, or if the
     *            string specifies a module name with a relative path, the

     *            searches for modules if loading the specified module causes
     *            the system to load other associated modules (that is, if the
     *            module has dependencies). The directories that are searched
     *            and the order in which they are searched depend on the
     *            specified path and the <em>dwFlags</em> parameter. For more
     *            information, see Remarks. <br>
     *            If the function cannot find the module or one of its

     *            This parameter is reserved for future use. It must be NULL.
     * @param flags
     *            The action to be taken when loading the module.<br>

     *            initialization and termination. Also, the system does not load

     *            compatibility. If you are planning to access only data or
     *            resources in the DLL, use LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE_EXCLUSIVE
     *            or LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE or both. Otherwise, load the
     *            library as a DLL or executable module using the LoadLibrary

     *            <br>

     *            If this value is used, the system does not check AppLocker
     *            rules or apply Software Restriction Policies for the DLL.
     *            AppLocker was introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008

     *            installation. <br>
     *            Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7: On systems with
     *            KB2532445 installed, the caller must be running as
     *            "LocalSystem" or "TrustedInstaller"; otherwise the system

     *            <br>
     *            LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE: 0x00000002<br>
     *            If this value is used, the system maps the file into the
     *            calling process's virtual address space as if it were a data
     *            file. Nothing is done to execute or prepare to execute the
     *            mapped file. Therefore, you cannot call functions like
     *            GetModuleFileName, GetModuleHandle or GetProcAddress with this
     *            DLL. Using this value causes writes to read-only memory to
     *            raise an access violation. Use this flag when you want to load
     *            a DLL only to extract messages or resources from it. <br>

     *            <br>
     *            LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE_EXCLUSIVE: 0x00000040<br>
     *            Similar to LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE, except that the DLL file
     *            is opened with exclusive write access for the calling process.
     *            Other processes cannot open the DLL file for write access
     *            while it is in use. However, the DLL can still be opened by
     *            other processes. <br>
     *            This value can be used with LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE.
     *            This value is not supported until Windows Vista. <br>
     *            <br>
     *            LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE: 0x00000020 <br>
     *            If this value is used, the system maps the file into the
     *            process's virtual address space as an image file. However, the
     *            loader does not load the static imports or perform the other
     *            usual initialization steps. Use this flag when you want to
     *            load a DLL only to extract messages or resources from it. <br>
     *            Unless the application depends on the file having the

     *            <br>
     *            LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR: 0x00000200<br>
     *            If this value is used, the application's installation
     *            directory is searched for the DLL and its dependencies.
     *            Directories in the standard search path are not searched. This
