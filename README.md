Java Native Access (JNA)
========================

The definitive JNA reference (including an overview and usage details) is in the [JavaDoc](http://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.5.1/javadoc/).  Please read the [overview](http://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.5.1/javadoc/overview-summary.html#overview_description).  Questions, comments, or exploratory conversations should begin on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users), although you may find it easier to find answers to already-solved problems on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jna).

JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.

JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like the call does in native code. Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.

JNA uses a small JNI library stub to dynamically invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures in the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI code for multiple platforms.  Read this [more in-depth description](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FunctionalDescription.md).

While significant attention has been paid to performance, correctness and ease of use take priority.

In addition, JNA includes a platform library with many native functions already mapped as well as a set of utility interfaces that simplify native access.

Projects Using JNA
==================
JNA is a mature library with dozens of contributors and hundreds of commercial and non-commercial projects that use it.  If you're using JNA, feel free to [tell us about it](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users).

There are also a number of examples and projects within the `contrib` directory of the JNA project itself.

Supported Platforms
===================
JNA will build on most linux-like platforms with a reasonable set of GNU tools and a JDK.  See the native [Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/java-native-access/jna/master/native/Makefile) for native configurations that have been built and tested.  If your platform is supported by [libffi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libffi), then chances are you can build JNA for it.

Pre-built platform support may be found [here](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/tree/master/lib/native).

Download

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.java.dev.jna/jna/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.java.dev.jna/jna)&nbsp;[jna.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna/4.5.1/jna-4.5.1.jar)

This is the core artifact of JNA and contains only the binding library and the
core helper classes.

JNA Platform
------------

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform) &nbsp; [jna-platform.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna-platform/4.5.1/jna-platform-4.5.1.jar)

This artifact holds cross-platform mappings and mappings for a number of commonly used platform
functions, including a large number of Win32 mappings as well as a set of utility classes
that simplify native access. The code is tested and the utility interfaces ensure that
native memory management is taken care of correctly.

See [PlatformLibrary.md](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/PlatformLibrary.md) for details.

Community and Support
=====================

All questions should be posted to the [jna-users Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users). Issues can be submitted [here on Github](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/issues).

When posting to the mailing list, please include the following:

* What OS/CPU/architecture you're using (e.g. Windows 7 64-bit)
* Reference to your native interface definitions (i.e. C headers), if available
* The JNA mapping you're trying to use
* VM crash logs, if any
* Example native usage, and your attempted Java usage

It's nearly impossible to indicate proper Java usage when there's no native
reference to work from.

For commercial support, please contact twalljava [at] java [dot] net.
