Title: libffi -- Portable foreign-function interface library
Abstract: The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming
 interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
 call any function specified by a call interface description at run
 time.
 .
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface
 is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one
 language to call code written in another language.  The libffi library
 really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured
 foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above libffi that handles
 type conversions for values passed between the two languages.
