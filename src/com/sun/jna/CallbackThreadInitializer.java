/**<p>This class provides for customization of the mapping of native threads
 * onto attached Java threads.  Use
 * {@link Native#setCallbackThreadInitializer} to customize the thread context
 * in which a given callback is invoked.</p>
 * <p>When a JNA callback is invoked on a native thread that is not currently
 * tracked by the VM and a <code>CallbackThreadInitiailizer</code> is
 * registered for that callback, the initializer object will be used to
 * determine how the thread should be attached to the VM.</p>
 * <p>Once attached, the method {@link Native#detach} may be used from within
 * the callback invocation to alter whether the thread will be detached or not
 * when the callback finishes execution.  Typically this functionality is used
 * in situations where you expect a callback to be called repeatedly from the
 * same thread and you want to avoid potential extra thread allocation
 * overhead on each callback invocation, since the VM may or may not re-use
 * the same allocated thread object each time the thread is attached.</p>
 * <p>A single initializer may be used for multiple callbacks, one initializer
 * per callback, or you may subclass the initializer to provide different
 * initializer settings depending on the callback.</p>
