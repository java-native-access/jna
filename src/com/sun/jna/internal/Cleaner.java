    /* General idea:
     *
     * There's one Cleaner per thread, kept in a ThreadLocal static variable.
     * This instance handles all to-be-cleaned objects registered by this
     * thread. Whenever the thread registers another object, it first checks
     * if there are references in the queue and cleans them up, then continues
     * with the registration.
     *
     * This leaves two cases open, for which we employ a "Master Cleaner" and
     * a separate cleaning thread.
     * 1. If a long-lived thread registers some objects in the beginning, but
     *    then stops registering more objects, the previously registered
     *    objects will never be cleared.
     * 2. When a thread exits before all its registered objects have been
     *    cleared, the ThreadLocal instance is lost, and so are the pending
     *    objects.
     *
     * The Master Cleaner handles the first issue by regularly checking the
     * activity of the Cleaners registered with it, and taking over the queues
     * of any cleaners appearing to be idle.
     * Similarly, the second issue is handled by taking over the queues of threads
     * that have terminated.
