STOP!  Read this before creating an issue.

This is not a Question and Answer forum. For general questions and support, use
the [JNA users' group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jna-users). Please search
message history there and on existing issues for duplicates. You may also find answers on
the [Using the Library](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna#using-the-library) section of the project 
home page or in the [FAQ](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.md).

Do NOT file an issue if you:
 - Are receiving a segfault or getting an Exception from your own JNA function/structure mapping
 - Want to know how to map a function
 - Want to know future plans for JNA
 - Want technical help or support of any kind
 - Are not yet sure if the issue you are facing is actually a JNA bug
 
All of these questions belong on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jna-users).
 
If you are certain you are reporting a bug, or you have a feature request that is
not of the form "please map this API function", then you may open an issue.
